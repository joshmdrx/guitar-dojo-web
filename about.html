        <h2><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> How Does It Work?</h2>
        <p>
          Guitar Dojo offers a daily training program customized to your skill
          level and goals. Here, practice is more about quality than quantity.
          Start each session with a short meditation to focus your mind, then
          dive into a daily practice that progressively builds technique and
          musicality. Whether you have just five minutes for a quick session
          with five exercises or can commit to a full 30-minute training, Guitar
          Dojo ensures that every minute of your practice counts.

          <i class="fas fa-dumbbell"></i> Explore Over 50 Technical Exercises
        </h2>
        <p>
          Guitar Dojo includes over 50 different technical exercises, curated
          into a daily practice regime. Play along with interactive tablature or
          simply use the metronome, and set a BPM that balances difficulty with
          precision - remember, you can only play as fast as you can play
          perfectly. There are no difficulty ratings for the exercises; instead,
          beginners should start slowly to build strength, while advanced
          players can push the limits of their abilities, striving to play
          cleanly at high tempos.
