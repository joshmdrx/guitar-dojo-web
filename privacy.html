      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Last updated: 23/08/2024</p>

      <p>
        Welcome to Guitar Dojo! We value your privacy, and this policy outlines
        how we handle your data.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
      <p>
        At Guitar Dojo, your privacy is of utmost importance to us. We do not
        collect, store, or process any personal data from our users directly.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        While Guitar Dojo does not collect any data directly, we do use a
        third-party service, <strong>RevenueCat</strong>, to manage in-app
        purchases and subscriptions. RevenueCat may collect certain data
        necessary for processing transactions and managing subscriptions. This
        data may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Purchase history</li>
        <li>Subscription status</li>
        <li>Identifiers for your device and app</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        RevenueCat's data collection and usage are governed by their own privacy
        policy. We encourage you to review
        <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank"
          >RevenueCat's Privacy Policy</a
        >
        to understand how they handle your data.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        Since we do not collect any data directly, there are no concerns
        regarding data security on our part. However, any data collected by
        RevenueCat is handled in accordance with their privacy practices, and we
        trust them to manage this information securely.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
        reflected on this page, and we encourage you to review this Privacy
        Policy periodically for any updates.
      </p>
